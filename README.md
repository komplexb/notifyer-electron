# Notifyer *Beta*
>*Be inspired*

## Why?
I made Notifyer, to help me remember and practice my mantras.

## What does it do?
Using Microsoft’s OneNote as a datastore, Notifyer utilizes OneNote’s API to retrieve a random note from a given section.  
Use case?  
- Get a daily quote from your curated collection.  
- Effortlessly resurface a buried quote and re-apply it to the present.

## How to use
#### Requirements
- [OneNote Account][] *(app accesses consumer notebooks only)*.  
- MacOS *(Only 64bit binaries are provided for MacOS, and the minimum MacOS version supported is MacOS 10.9)*.
- Windows 10, 7 (without notifications).

#### Get Started
1. Sign-in or create a **free** [OneNote Account][].
2. In your default/primary notebook, create a section with the name **Quotes**.
3. Add a couple notes to the **Quotes** section.
4. [Download Notifyer][]. Run the app and sign in.
5. Just want to demo the app? [Ping me](http://twitter.com/komplexb) and I'll send you credentials.

#### Help
- The app sends a notification every 5 minutes so you can easily see it work. You might want to change that to daily. *(Restart the app if it doesn't stop)*.
- Random (via [Chance][]) means you might see the same note in close succession.
- Cmd+Alt+O triggers a random note even when the app is minimized.
- Clicking the notification opens the app.
- The app displays a preview text snippet (**max 300 characters**) for each note.
- Clicking the **note title** in the app opens the source note in the OneNote client or web app.
- Disabled fields mean you can't change that setting just yet.


## Build Setup*
#### Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/).
